# PM_SHRI_SCHOOLS_DATA_VISUALIZATION
# 📍 Bihar Schools Interactive Map (PM SHRI Project)

## 🔹 Project Overview  
This project transforms an **unclean dataset of 836 schools across Bihar** into a fully interactive **geospatial map**.  
The visualization highlights each school’s location, district boundaries, and block-level details.  

📢 Proud moment: this work, which started as a small sibling favour, has now been **adopted by the Ministry of Education, Bihar** and published on the **official PM SHRI Portal** of the **Ministry of Education, Government of India**.

## 🔹 Problem Statement  
The challenge was to take a raw, unorganized Excel dataset of schools and transform it into a clear, interactive visualization where:  
- 🏫 Each school could be seen on the map  
- 🗺️ District boundaries were crisp and filled with unique colors  
- 📝 Hovering over a marker revealed school, block, and district details  

In short, the task was to turn messy Excel rows into a **geospatial map** that is both informative and visually intuitive.

## 🔹 Tools & Libraries  
- **Python** – flexible for data + GIS tasks  
- **Pandas** – cleaned and structured the dataset (836 rows → usable form)  
- **GeoPandas** – handled district boundaries (GeoJSON) and spatial data  
- **Folium** – built the interactive map (markers, labels, popups, tooltips)  
- **Matplotlib Colors** – assigned unique colors to each district  
- **Google Colab** – quick, no-setup environment to run everything in the cloud

## 🔹 Data Sources  
- 📊 School dataset: raw Excel provided by stakeholder (cleaned manually)  
- 🌍 District boundaries: **GADM (Global Administrative Areas
